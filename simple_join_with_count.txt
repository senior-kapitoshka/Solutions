--For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will 
--return all columns from the people table, and join to the toys table so that 
--you can return the COUNT of the toys

--people table schema
----id
----name
--toys table schema
----id
----name
----people_id
--You should return all people fields as well as the toy count as "toy_count".


select p.id,p.name, count(t.name) as  toy_count
from people p join toys t
on p.id = t.people_id
group by p.id


-------------------

SELECT p.*, COUNT(t) AS toy_count
FROM people p
JOIN toys t
  ON t.people_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id
